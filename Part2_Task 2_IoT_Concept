Implementation notes for simulation
Synthetic data generation:

Weather: Use historical seasonal patterns to simulate daily T/RH/rain.

Soil moisture: Water balance model driven by rain/irrigation and evapotranspiration.

Evaluation:

Metrics: MAE/RMSE for yield; precision/recall for risk alerts.

A/B simulation: Compare “AI-advised” vs “baseline” management policies.
